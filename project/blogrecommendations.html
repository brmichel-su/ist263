<h1>My Favorite Travel Blogs </h1>
<p> Now that I shared my travel blog with you guys I wanted to also share what blog I read whenever I need some travel inspiration. I look at these travel blogs one too many times throughout my days. What can I say, the coronavirus has made me even more desperate to jump on a flight once it's safe. Warning before viewing these blogs: you may also want to book a flight immediately after clicking on those links. </p>

<p> Indy’s blog isn’t necessarily a travel blog, but does include a ton of travel content since she has gone to 30 countries in five years. She also has a unique way of making travel extremely funny and relatable by including stories with her friends and trendy slang. Trust me she is not your average influencer. Indy can even make staying in a dirty hostel in France seem cool.Her YouTube videos are what truly drew me into her blog. The video provides footage from dream travel locations that will make you want to jump on a plane with all your friends immediately. From a production standpoint the videos are extremely well done with crisp editing timed to music.

<h2> <a href="https://worldofwanderlust.com/"> World of Wanderlust</a></h2>

<p> World of Wanderlust is a blog by a 26 year old Millennial who empowers women to solo travel the world. I believe this is such an important message to girls that feel as if they cannot travel due to not having a partner, family, friends, etc., who all share this common goal. I mean I may be biased with this choice of blog considering her name is “Brooke” too, just kidding. This blog deserves all the hype because she is able to produce useful written content for her audience as well as aesthetically pleasing photography, a book club and even merchandise. A unique fact about Brooke is that she does not just visit locations, but also lives in some for an extended period of time and documents it all for us. For example, she most recently moved to Tasmania.  </p>

<p> I know what you are thinking--yes, this travel blog suggestion is very off-brand of me. My PR professor last semester actually made me aware of this blogger and I have to say this blog has been a valuable resource. I feel like now that I am adulting, saving money on flights is more important than spending my time looking at aesthetic travel Instagram pages by influencers. Basically the Point Guy gives you the inside scoop on how to use points/miles and credit cards to make your flights cheaper. It kind of feels like my dad giving me advice when I was renting my first apartment except more fun because it has to do with travel. </p>
