      <h1>The Ultimate Guide to Planning a Greece Trip</h1>
      <p> If you know me then you know there is nothing I love more than these three things: </p> <br>
      <ol>
 
        1. Traveling <br>
        2. Photography <br>
        3. Mamma Mia! 
      </ol>
    <p>The list above is why in 2016 I called my two best friends and suggested we go to Greece for the summer. Yes, I did mean the whole summer which is 10 weeks to be exact. You may be wondering how I afforded to do this as a girl just trying to scrape up enough money to finally buy a car. Somehow with just $6,500 for three people we managed to pull off 10 weeks and 14 destinations in Greece as well as an epic social media feed to prove it all did happen.</p> <br>
    <p> Before I make you drool with a photo diary of my vacation in Greece in my next blog post we need to get down to business on the planning that led up to the summer of my dreams. </p> <br>

<div id="tips">
<div id="tip1">
    <h2> Book Flights </h2>
    <p> In order to book flights pick dates of the earliest you could leave home and the latest you could return from your destination. Book flights to Greece early, especially if going in summer months or using air miles which do not allow for much flexibility in travel dates.  </p>
</div>

<div id="tip2">
    <h2> Research and Pick Destinations</h2>
    <p>Research islands or destinations in Greece to determine which ones you want to visit. In a travel book, I found this chart rating all the islands on various criteria such as nightlife, scenery, beaches, eating, etc. This will help you when picking out the islands or destinations you want to visit. If you want to be dancing in the club with your girls then go to Mykonos. If you want a zen escape from your hectic work life then go to Elafonisos. If you're a girl who truly wants it all like me then go to Crete. </p>
</div>
<div id="tip3">
    <h2> Choose Order of Destinations</h2>
    <p> Once you have selected the locations within Greece you want to visit, start to develop a travel route. Pull up a map and look at the geographical location of all your destinations to sequence a logical travel route. </p>
</div>
<div id="tip4">
    <h2> Purchase Ferry Tickets </h2>
    <p>Driving a rental car on some islands in Greece is a money saver. In order to drive in a foreign country, you need to register for an International Driving Permit through AAA unless you want to feel like a 15-year-old again who needs their mom to drive them everywhere. It is important to check your current car insurance for coverage on overseas rentals.  </p>
</div>
<div id="tip5">
    <h2> Gain Access to Foreign Currency</h2>
    <p>Prepare to be able to convert money into local currency by setting up access to your money through your local bank. A pro tip is to convert a small number of dollars to euros at your local bank before flying to Greece. You never know if you’ll be “hangry” straight off the plane. Having some euros in your wallet will be convenient when you don’t have to look for an ATM while hauling your luggage and instead can immediately go to McDonald’s. Unlike The Notorious B.I.G. if you have no money you’ll still have “mo problems.”</p>
