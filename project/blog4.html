    <h1> The Best Micro-cation During COVID-19</h1>
    <p> The coronavirus has micro-cations the new hot vacation trend as the coronavirus has ruined any hope for a long getaway in the Bahamas. However, after doing some exploring in New England I realized that Cape Cod is not a bad trade-off especially when the other option is staying home on your couch eating potato chips while Netflix asks if you're still watching for the fifth time that day. Cape Cod ended up being the peaceful weekend escape I needed in August after a summer of worrying about whether or not I’d ever feel the touch of sand on my feet again. Here are some of the highlights from my trip and recommendations for if you plan on venturing outside of your home soon. Don't worry Cape Cod is COVID-19 friendly aka. you can still wear sweats and not brush your hair. </p>

<div id="theknackimg"> <img src="projectimages/theknack.jpg" alt=" The Knack Restaurant" height="300" width="300"> <br> </div>
    <h2> The Knack </h2>
    <p> This is what I would pick for my last supper. What more could a girl need than chicken tenders, a juicy burger and salty fries. This is the place I would go to for casual dinners when I wanted a quick dining experience. Every night can’t be a five-course meal of fine wining and dining, unfortunately. The Knack offers a pick-up service or you can go to the restaurant to order at the window. There are tables that you can eat at which comply with the social distance regulations. </p>

    <h2> Cape Escape Adventure Golf </h2>
    <p> Mini golfing was our favorite fun activity to do while staying in Cape Cod. After eating at The Knack we would go to Cape Escape Adventure Golf to burn off some calories. Honestly, most of us were more interested in working out our family power dynamics through competition rather than actually exercising. There was blood, sweat and tears shed by the end of the night. Make sure to schedule a reservation ahead of time since the business is only allowing half the capacity to be on the course at a time. All the equipment was disinfected and we felt very comfortable as all the customers were spaced out more than necessary. </p>

<div id="nasuet">
<div id="nasuetimg"> <img src="projectimages/nasuet.jpg" alt="Sunny Nauset Beach" height="300" width="300"> <br> </div>
    <h2> Nauset Beach </h2>
    <p> Nauset Beach is my favorite place on this Earth. From the rolling waves to the dreamy dunes there is nowhere as peaceful to enjoy a day soaking in the sunshine. The beach is very well maintained and not well populated as many of the people who go to this beach have homes in the neighborhood. As a result, you will have people driving onto the beach. I know that sounds unpleasant but the cars are parked far down the beach out of eyesight. However, there is no lifeguard on the stand so make sure you are careful about following the shark flag warnings and do not swim when the tides are rough.  </p>

    <h2> Rock Harbor Grill</h2>
    <p> You know how I mentioned above that The Knack is not the place for a five-course meal well Rock Harbor Grill is the place. My personal recommendation is to go early to your reservation and have a drink outside by the fire pit. Then make sure to try the mussels and lobster mac & cheese. Trust me you won’t regret it even by the end of the night when your belly feels as if you’re eight months pregnant. </p>

   <h2> Weekend </h2>
   <p> I could not end this post without mentioning a boutique for all my girls who want to shop while on vacation. Weekend Boutique is a highly curated shop that also has many handmade goodies. They have Nauset Beach clothing merchandise and handmade art. I linked some of my favorite finds from Weekend below. </p>
