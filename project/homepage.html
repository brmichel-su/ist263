    <p> Hi! I’m Brooke Michell, a junior PR student at Syracuse University. Before I decided to spend all day staring at books in my university library, I made it my mission to travel as much of the world as possible. Every summer during high school I escaped the New Jersey suburbs to road trip for three months either in Western U.S.A or Europe. While I was traveling I photographed most of the breathtaking scenery and also all the silly shenanigans that happened along the way. My friends often joke that “I have a crush on the world” and I would have to agree. If you caught the travel bug just like me, stick around and take a look at my travel guides and photography for some tips for your next trip or just a quick travel fix.
