    <h1>Brooke Michell's Biography</h1>
    <h2> Personal Info</h2>
    <p> 
    Hello! My name is Brooke Michell and I am currently a <strong>junior Public Relations student</strong> at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. I have always had a passion for writing and am looking forward to exploring the way social media is shaping PR. After I took an introductory information technology course last year I realized how interested I was in the way the communications field intertwined with technology and data. This is why I am minoring in Information Management and Technology at the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. The ability to understand the technology and analytics side of PR is becoming increasingly important in my opinion. I have made the Dean's List every semester of college. Recently I explored the professional workspace outside of the educational walls by pursuing an internship in the fashion industry at a luxury sleepwear company, Morgan Lane.

     Besides being involved in my sorority on campus, I spend my free time shooting pictures and film. I have traveled to 17 countries in the past seven years and hope to continue to grow that list. I believe my extensive travel experience will be an asset to organizations through my ability to provide and understand a global perspective.
